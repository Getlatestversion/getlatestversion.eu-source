TODO

## Undeployable
Congratulations! You are leveraging that spectacular feature available only in the latest version of Windows/Ubuntu/RedHat… but your company only supports LTS versions. You’re welcome.
This is a core principle of Agile and thus DevOps: communications. Do not assume. Ask. Negotiate.
## No agents
Maybe you have permission to install the latest SDK on your development machine, but it is someone else managing the build servers.
