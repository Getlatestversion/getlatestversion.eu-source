I want to be able to paste images, I've found an addin

![Image finally pasted with this addin](/images/alkampfer/2020-04-04-09-35-31.png)

Ok I've understood that everything that is static should be placed inside
static, but static is not poart of the path (I've followed an old post that states
that images should be in static and referred as /static/..)

Now it seems to work, here is the setting I use to put the image in the right place
