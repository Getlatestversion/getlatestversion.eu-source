## About Us

GetLatestVersion.eu stems from GetLatestVersion.it, the successful Italian community specialised on DevOps, Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC).

## What we do

We publish posts and articles on DevOps, Agile, tools, design, implementation techniques.
Our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/GetLatestVersion) hosts useful video of different kind: short introductions to a topic or tool, longer presentation on experiences and conference sessions. 
In addition, we organise events in person and online on DevOps, Agile, ALM and SDLC topics.
